# Regression Challenge
Predicting the selling price of a residential property depends on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location.

In this challenge, you will use a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on its features. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.
